\begin{abstract}
Data driven research has shown a growing tendency in recent years 
as newer technologies emerge that enable extensive
natural phenomena measurement and diverse data collection. 
However, tools to deal with inter-disciplinary data discovery 
and analysis have not been able to keep up with the increasing 
big-data-generation methods. To tackle this problem, we have created 
a data service that allows users from different domains to access relevant 
data without bothering about \emph{how} or \emph{where} the data is stored. 
% This data service works as translator from different database paradigms by 
% unifying the content of the databases in a specific format. 
We also investigated different parallelization strategies to improve the 
scalability of our data service.
